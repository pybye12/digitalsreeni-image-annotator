# Glossary

## Terms and Definitions

### Annotation
A marked region on an image, either a polygon (segmentation) or rectangle (bounding box), associated with a class label.

### Bounding Box (bbox)
A rectangular annotation defined by `[x, y, width, height]` in COCO format. Stored in annotation as `"bbox"` key.

### Class
A category label for annotations (e.g., "cell", "nucleus", "mitochondria"). Each class has an ID and color.

### Clip
A selected inclusive range of frames from a longer video, optionally sampled
with a stride. Clips are decoded to disk-backed image sequences for labeling.

### COCO Format
Common Objects in Context - a standardized JSON format for object detection and segmentation annotations. Includes images, categories, and annotations with segmentation polygons or bounding boxes.

### CZI File
Carl Zeiss Image file format for multi-dimensional microscopy images. Contains metadata and multi-channel Z-stacks.

### DINO / Grounding DINO
"DINO" in this codebase refers specifically to **Grounding DINO** (IDEA-Research, 2023) — an open-set object detector that takes a natural-language phrase ("drone", "wing of an aircraft") and returns bounding boxes for matching regions of an image. Not to be confused with the self-supervised vision-only DINOv1/v2 backbones (similar name, different model). Models live under `models/grounding-dino-base/` and `models/grounding-dino-tiny/`.

### Multi-dimensional Image
An image with more than 2 dimensions, typically from microscopy. Dimensions include T (time), Z (depth), C (channel), S (scene), H (height), W (width).

### NMS (Non-Maximum Suppression)
Post-processing step that removes redundant overlapping boxes. After Grounding DINO scores many candidate boxes, NMS keeps only the highest-scoring one per cluster — controlled per-class via the **NMS thr** column in the DINO panel (higher = more aggressive de-duplication).

### Paint Brush Tool
Drawing tool that creates freeform annotations by painting a mask with adjustable brush size. Converted to polygon contours when finished.

### Pascal VOC
Visual Object Classes dataset format. XML-based annotation format primarily for bounding boxes.

### Phrase (DINO)
A free-form text description used by Grounding DINO to find objects. Each annotation class has a list of phrases — for example a "drone" class might use phrases `["drone", "quadcopter", "octocopter", "helicopter"]`. The class name itself is always the first phrase and cannot be removed.

### Polygon / Segmentation
A closed shape annotation defined by a list of vertex coordinates `[x1, y1, x2, y2, ...]`. Stored in annotation as `"segmentation"` key.

### Project
A saved workspace containing images, classes, and annotations. Stored as a `.json` file with absolute paths to images.

### SAM / SAM 2
Segment Anything Model - Meta's foundation model for image segmentation. Version 2 (SAM 2) is used in this application.

### SAM Point Mode
Annotation mode where user clicks positive points (inside object) and negative points (outside object) to guide SAM segmentation.

### Semantic Labels
Single-channel image where each pixel value represents the class ID. Used for semantic segmentation training.

### RGB Semantic Mask
Three-channel image where each pixel's RGB value identifies its class. The
ER70S-6 workflow uses black background plus the exact team palette configured
by the welding presets.

### Slice
A 2D image extracted from a multi-dimensional image stack. Named with format `{filename}_T{t}_Z{z}_C{c}_S{s}`.

### Source Frame Index
The original zero-based position of a frame in its source video. It is kept
separately from the frame's position inside a selected clip.

### Stride
The interval used when sampling video frames. A stride of `1` keeps every
frame; a stride of `5` keeps frames 0, 5, 10, and so on within the selection.

### Stack
A multi-dimensional image, typically a TIFF or CZI file with multiple 2D slices in Z-dimension (depth).

### Subprocess Worker (historical)
A standalone Python script (`sam_worker.py`, `dino_worker.py`) that ran ML model inference in its own process to dodge a PyQt5 + Torch DLL load-order conflict on Windows + Python 3.14. Removed once the codebase migrated to PyQt6 (the conflict no longer manifests). See [ADR-011](09_architecture_decisions.md#adr-011-run-torch-based-workers-in-isolated-subprocesses) (Superseded) and [ADR-013](09_architecture_decisions.md#adr-013-in-process-inference-with-qthread-wrapping).

### TIFF Stack
Multi-page TIFF file containing multiple 2D images, often used for Z-stacks in microscopy.

### YOLO Format
You Only Look Once - object detection format. Uses `.txt` files with normalized coordinates: `class_id x_center y_center width height`.

### Z-Stack
A series of 2D images taken at different focal depths (Z positions), used in microscopy to capture 3D structure.
